                <h3>Hatha Yoga</h3>
                <img src="Hatha-Yoga.jpeg" alt="yoga">
                <p>A gentle introduction to basic yoga postures.
                    The Sanskrit term "hatha" is an umbrella term for all physical postures of yoga. 
                    In the West, hatha yoga simply refers to all the other styles of yoga (ashtanga, Iyengar, etc.) that are grounded in a physical practice. However, there are other branches of yoga such as kriya, raja, and karma yoga that are separate from the physical-based yoga practice. 
                    The physical-based yoga is the most popular and has numerous styles.

                <img src="Vini-Yoga (1).jpeg" alt="yoga">
                <p>Dynamic sequences synchronized with breath.
                    Vinyasa means "to place in a special way" and, in this case, yoga postures. Vinyasa yoga is often considered the most athletic yoga style, and was adapted from ashtanga yoga in the 1980s.
                     Many types of yoga can also be considered "vinyasa flows," such as ashtanga, power yoga, and prana.

                <h3>Ashtanga yoga</h3>
                <img src="Ashtanga-Yoga.jpeg" alt="yoga">
                <p>                    In Sanskrit, ashtanga is translated as "Eight Limb path." In Mysore, India, people gather to practice this form of yoga together at their own paceâ€”if you see Mysore-led ashtanga, it's expected of you to know the series. Vinyasa yoga stems from ashtanga as the flowing style linking breath to movement.
                     To learn more about this specific practice, check out our beginner's guide to ashtanga yoga.</p>

                <img src="ardhacakrasana.jpeg" alt="yoga">
                <p>
                    
                    Anusara is a modern-day version of hatha yoga, most similar to vinyasa in that it focuses on alignment, but with more emphasis on the mind-body-heart connection. It was founded by John Friend who created a unique system called the Universal Principals of Alignment. He resigned in 2012 after accusations of sexual misconduct and financial mismanagement. 
                    Friend has since partnered with Desi and Micah Springer to teach the Bowspring method.</p>

                <p>
                    Prenatal yoga is carefully adapted for moms-to-be, and is tailored to women in all trimesters. Many have said that prenatal is one of the best types of exercise for expectant moms because of the pelvic floor work,
                     focus on breathing, and bonding with the growing baby. Prenatal yoga also helps mothers prepare for labor and delivery.</p>
