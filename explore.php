                <h4>Janardhan Keshav</h4>
                <p>“To face the awesome part of ourselves is a difficult thing to do. We live in a mundane reality and to go from the mundane to the unexplainable is a huge step for the mind.”<br> -Swami Radhananda<br>

                   <br> How do you hold this inner reality of being created by Divine Light while living in a physical world of relationships, work, home and world events?<br>
                     Is it possible to bridge these worlds, allowing easier passage from one to the other?<br> Opening the heart and experiencing awe and wonder in daily life, memory and practice holds a key.<br>
                     This retreat includes visualization, reflection, drawing and spiritual practices</p>
            </div>
            <div class="team-member">
                               <h4> Smitha Akashay</h4>
                <p>Relaxation offers the possibility of becoming still, softening and opening.<br>
                     The healing benefits – physically, emotionally and mentally – can be profound. 
                     <br>Awareness expands bringing the Light of wisdom and understanding. 
                    The focus for this retreat includes guided relaxation, meditation and asana as well as tools to help you open to your own personal symbolism.</p>

                               <h4>Manohar Patel</h4>
                <p>“The Heart is symbolic for the centre of our spiritual being–limitless compassion and knowledge beyond the intellect.”<br> Swami Radha<br><br>

                    The ground of the Heart is where we can open to inspiration and understanding. <br>In this retreat, we offer practices of reflection, mantra, visualization, silence and breath to deepen a connection to the inner source of love.
                    <br> By listening and becoming receptive to your still, small voice, you can invite healing that clears the way for finer feelings like gratitude and compassion. <br>What does your heart say? 
                    And how can listening to its messages improve your relationships–first to yourself, then to those around you?</p>

                               <h4>Leele Ram</h4>
                <p>"You can cultivate the positive attributes of kindness and love by laying a strong foundation of understanding of your own life." <br>Swami Radhananda<br><br>

                    Being compassionate towards ourselves, those around us and the world requires the willingness and courage to be kind-hearted.<br> How do you live an ideal of compassion in a world that seems to express so much of the opposite?
                     How can you deepen your understanding so kindness and concern can grow? Using practices of visualization, meditation and breath, experience the gift of an open heart.</p>
